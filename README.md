C++ Data Structures
===================

This is for all those interviewers out there who want to see 
someone write code on a whiteboard with markers. Yes, that
takes skills, but it also takes practice. Since at some point
I would need a job, this is a repository that house all the
C++ data structures from linked list, to Fibonacci Heaps.
Over time, it also has solutions to interesting problems like
"Strawberry Fields" or "Security Cameras in a Gallery". There
is also a C# Data Structures, and a Java Data Structures. I
am not going to write a Ruby Data Structures, because I respect
the language too much to waste it on exercises of this nature.
Haskell on the other hand...
